# TrainScheduler
Assignment created to incorporate Firebase that will host arrival and departure created by "administrators" and manipulated by moment.js. Should provide up to date information about various "trains" and according to the assignment: will show arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their "station."

This project was created to give my class data side practice using firebase so it could be linked to a practice portfolio.

It's ongoing and allows different users to upload information about oncoming "trains" and also reference previous submissions of shared information. 

Code used: Javascript - jQuery - CSS/Bootstrap - Moment.js

Reference: https://momentjs.com/

How to use: Inpection of code will note the firebase calls within and the info will be display on the DOM using jQuery!

Thanks to UC Davis Coding Bootcamp FSF program for another fun project.
