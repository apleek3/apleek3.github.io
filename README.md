## Welcome to my profile repository.

Included herein are 9 projects that I'm particularly proud of including a group project that showcases 20 weeks of hard learning and teamwork!

I still have a lot to learn and I'm continuously working with outside learning resources on PluralSight and FreeCodeCamp to develop my Full Stack Development skills.
